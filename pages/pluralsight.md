   But the course is not deep enough.
1. [Searching and Analyzing Data with Elasticsearch: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/elasticsearch-analyzing-data/table-of-contents).\

   But still, it's a good intro to `Elasticsearch`.
1. [Haskell Fundamentals Part 1](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/haskell-fundamentals-part1/table-of-contents).\
   `Haskell` is a nice language, but the course did not really convince me to start use it.\
   `F#` is a better option for `.net` developers still.
1. [Cloud Design Patterns for Azure: Availability and Resilience](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/azure-design-patterns-availability-resilience/table-of-contents).\
   The described patterns are quite simple to spend two hours on it.\
   Good point is that `Azure` does not really mater here.
1. [Design Identity Management in Microsoft Azure](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/microsoft-azure-identity-management-design/table-of-contents).\
   Just high a level review of Azure AD capabilities.

1. [Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect: Implement a Virtual Networking Strategy](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/microsoft-azure-solutions-architect-implement-virtual-networking-strategy/table-of-contents).\
   It jumps too fast into the topic.\
   You need some background to understand the material.

## ★ I learned nothing new on these courses or really did not like it for some reasons

1. [Practical HTML5](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/practical-html5/table-of-contents).\
   Too basic.
1. [CSS Positioning](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/css-positioning-1834/table-of-contents).\
   Maybe useful for a novice.
1. [AngularJS Best Practices](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-best-practices/table-of-contents).
1. [Modern, Modular JavaScript with SystemJS and jspm](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/javascript-systemjs-jspm/table-of-contents).\
   Technically, it's a great course about `SystemJS`.\
   But seriously? 7:25 hours for the technology that is outdated now?
1. [EF Core 1.0: First Look](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/play-by-play-ef-core-1-0-first-look-julie-lerman/table-of-contents).\
   Not much about EF Core itself.
1. [Domain-Driven Design Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/domain-driven-design-fundamentals/table-of-contents).\
   Promotes really bad examples of code design, like using EF `IQueryable` right in a business logic code.
1. [Using OpenAPI/Swagger for Testing and Code Generation in ASP.NET Core](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dot-net-openapi-swagger-testing-code-generation/table-of-contents).
1. [Microsoft Azure: The Big Picture](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/microsoft-azure-big-picture/).\
   Just outdated.
1. [Design Authorization for Microsoft Azure](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/microsoft-azure-authorization-design/table-of-contents).\
   It did not show how to use RBAC properly.

## Dropped

1. [Building a Real-time App with React, Flux, Webpack, and Firebase](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/build-isomorphic-app-react-flux-webpack-firebase/table-of-contents).\
   I dropped it because I chose `Angular` and `TypeScript` for frontend. At that moment.
1. [Design Authentication for Microsoft Azure](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/microsoft-azure-authentication-design/table-of-contents).\
   It's high level review of Azure AD capabilities, I need something more practical.
1. [Microsoft Azure Architecture for AWS Architects](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/microsoft-azure-architecture-aws-architects-update/table-of-contents).\
   Not enough knowledge to fully understand it.
1. [AWS Developer: Lambda Deep Dive](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/aws-developer-lambda-deep-dive/table-of-contents).\
   Maybe next time.
