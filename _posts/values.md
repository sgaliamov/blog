Developers spend most of their time focusing on the technical aspects of programming.
We like best practices, principles, design patterns, and anything that helps us create good software.
And this is good.

But there are other important things that are perhaps even more important than this.
Some people may refer to this as "Soft skills".
But I don't like this name because this things are not "soft" and not quite skills.

I would say that these are a values.
A misunderstanding of these values will lead to the collapse of any project, even if it follows the most perfect best practices.
And the opposite is true as well.
A deep acceptance of these values can even compensate for a lack of technical skills.

## Simplicity

I put this first because it matters.
It’s very easy to create a complex solution.
You don’t need to be a senior to make a really sophisticated thing.
Literally anyone can do it, and then think that he did something cool just because it looks complex.
But maintaining it isn't cool.
Designing a simple, easy-to-maintain solution that even a junior can support is very challenging.
Principles like SOLID, “Composition over Inheritance”, KISS, YAGNI help to fight with complexity and entropy,
but they won't work if a developer thinks that creating a big multilevel class hierarchy is what programming about.

## Moderation

Simplicity is the result of maturity and experience.
Following best practices is a good thing.
But very often developers jump onto new technologies, patterns and methodologies just for the sake of their use and not for the solving problems.
As result, we often can see projects in a poor condition where multiple different architectures are applied.

There so much interesting things in software engineering, and it’s hard to blame developers that they want to try everything.
In addition we all want to be up to date to be competitive on the market.
To be professional and efficient we should always “sharpen the saw”.

The only problem is that, they try on production code and run away when they realize that cannot maintain it anymore.
I just want developers be careful when they introduce heavy, irrevocable decisions.
Doing own pet projects is the great way to experiment and to learn without breaking production code and making others live harder.

## Pragmatism

No one need coding for sake of coding.
If you are not scientist or artist of course.
And we are not. We are engineers.
We write programs to make others live better and easier.

For example, 100% coverage sounds good.
But think how much other cool thing you could build instead of writing tests?

Sometimes I think that whole software exists just because we cut edges all the times.

Good developer - is a lazy developer.
"Quality in a service or product is not what you put into it.It is what the client or customer gets out of it." - Peter Drucker.

## Supportiveness

 We work in teams to achieve a bigger result than we can accomplish alone.
 This is why we should think more about the value we create than about our ego.
 We should think more how to help our teammates than about current needs or interests.

## Passion and patience

People who care about their work tend to provide better results.
But passion has a dark side.
Sometimes people go too far and can’t handle emotions.
People often talk about the giving feedback skill, but for some reason, they ignore the receiving feedback skill.
I think, ability adequately receiving any feedback is more important skill.
There is a nasty trick.
If someone tells you that he knows better, don’t argue, just do what he says.
This is the way to share responsibility for the case if something will go wrong.
And it will.
We all know that developers always miss with their estimations.
So, failure won't be yours alone.
And opposite. If you know that someone is doing wrong, and doesn’t want to listen.
Don’t worry. Let people make their own mistakes.
At least they will learn something. If you were right, they will listen eventually.
Be passionate and patient.

## Ownership and responsibility



## Professionalism

It's a really big topic

## Passion for learning
