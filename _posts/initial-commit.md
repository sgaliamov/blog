Why do I start this blog?

There are several reasons for this, and some of them are purely pragmatic:

1. I want to form and finalize some of my thoughts so that they finally stop spinning in my head and make room for other things. Itâ€™s a huge waste of time when you come back to the same ideas several times, think and say the same thoughts over and over again without going further.
1. I need to practice my English and learn how to express myself quickly and well.
1. I need strong arguments for controversy and discussion. Sometimes you are just not thinking fast enough, and a good argument only comes to mind after a discussion. But the time has already passed.
1. I want my mindset to be visible to potential employers and teams. I want to work with people who value the same ideas as me.
1. I need a place where I can present the results of my work.
1. And maybe I'll make the world a little better if what I say makes sense and someone reads it, uses it and benefits from it.
